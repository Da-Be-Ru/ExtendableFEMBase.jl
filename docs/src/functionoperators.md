# Function Operators

## StandardFunctionOperators

StandardFunctionOperators are abstract types that encode primitive (linear) operators (like Identity, Gradient etc.)
used to dispatch different evaluations of finite element basis functions.

!!! note

    As each finite element type is transformed differently from the reference domain to the general domain,
    the evaluation of each function operator has to be implemented for each finite element class.
    Currently, not every function operator works in any dimension and for any finite element. More evaluations
    are added as soon as they are needed (and possibly upon request).
    Also, the function operators can be combined with user-defined actions to evaluate other operators that
    can be build from the ones available (e.g. the deviator).

Modules = [ExtendableFEMBase]
Pages = ["functionoperators.jl"]

```


## ReconstructionOperators

There are special operators that allow to evaluate a primitive operator of some discrete
reconstructed version of a testfunction. 

```@autodocs
Modules = [ExtendableFEMBase]
Pages = ["reconstructionoperators.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
```

### Divergence-free reconstruction operators
For gradient-robust discretisations of certain classical non divergence-conforming ansatz spaces,
reconstruction operators are available that map a discretely divergence-free H1 function to a pointwise divergence-free
Hdiv function. So far such operators are available for the vector-valued Crouzeix-Raviart (H1CR) and Bernardi--Raugel (H1BR) finite element types,
as well as for the P2-bubble (H1P2B) finite element type in two dimensions.

**Example:** Reconst{HDIVRT0{d}, Identity} gives the reconstruction of the Identity operator into HDIVRT0 (and is available for H1BR{d} and H1CR{d} for d = 1,2)



## Operator Pairs (experimental)

Two function operators can be put into an OperatorPair so that one can provide effectively two operators in each argument of an assembly pattern. However, the user should make sure that both operators can be evaluated together reasonably (meaning both should be well-defined on the element geometries and the finite element space where the argument will be evaluated, and the action of the operator has to operate with coressponding input and result fields). This feature is still experimental and might have issues in some cases. OperatorTriple for a combination of three operators is also available.
